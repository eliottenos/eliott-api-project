Explanation:

My app is effectively a travel advice blog.  Users can input specific cities,
also specifying the country and zipcode, before leaving a comment.  These can be can
be searched for via their id and the properties are displayed on the screen.
They can also be deleted by the user.  This is a useful app for people looking to record
their travel advice.

I would have liked to expand on the UI much more to make it more visually appealing.
Also I would like to connect to a 3rd party weather API so that users can search a zipcode
for the weather.  I have already signed up with the API and have the key to implement this.
